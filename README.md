## Project Description
Sunshine Smoothies is an e-commerce application that lets users shop for smoothies, create their own smoothie, and edit smoothies. Smoothies are stored in a database. Users can see the smoothies they create as well as the smoothies created by others. The store also has a default selection of smoothies. If a user is signed in theyâ€™ll have the ability to create or edit smoothies.
